This project contains a source code accompanying the article "Ray Traced Shadows: Maintaining Real-Time Frame Rates", by Jakub Boksansky, Michael Wimmer, and Jiri Bittner which appears in the [Ray Tracing Gems](http://www.raytracinggems.com) book.

As the source code depends on the [Falcor framework](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/Falcor), we've added it to the solution. In case you're already using Falcor for a different project (or want an updated version), you can remove it from our solution and [follow the instructions on the Falcor page](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/Falcor) on how to link Falcor to our project.

Build note: Make sure to place the project into a path that does not contain spaces to prevent build errors.
