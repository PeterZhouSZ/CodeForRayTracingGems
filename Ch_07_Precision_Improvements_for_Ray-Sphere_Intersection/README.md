# Precision Improvements for Ray/Sphere Intersection

The ray/sphere intersection experiments are part of the system found at [https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/GettingStartedWithRTXRayTracing](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/GettingStartedWithRTXRayTracing). Unfortunately, this code base is not currently in working order, as [Falcor](https://developer.nvidia.com/falcor) has moved on. However, the code file here gives various options, which can be adapted to any ray-tracing system.
