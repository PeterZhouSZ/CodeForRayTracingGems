The whole implementation described in the second phase has been integrated in Unreal Engine, so is available in [Epic's GitHub repository](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine).

The ray tracing code is part of [Unreal Engine 4.22](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/4-22-preview-1-now-available).
